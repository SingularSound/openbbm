## Reporting bugs

**Did you find a bug?**
- Ensure the bug was not previously reported, by searching on the  [Issues](https://github.com/SingularSound/openbbm/issues) section.
- Make sure to use a clear and descriptive title to identify the problem.
- Describe the steps to recreate the bug, the behavior you observed after following the steps pointing out what exactly is the problem with that behavior. And explain which behavior you expected to see instead, and why.
- Include details of your current configuration, and running platform.
- If you just notice something weird but are not sure is a bug, you can always contact the developers to check.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you want to add new features, make sure to:
   - Check the enhancement hasn't already been suggested on the [Issues](https://github.com/SingularSound/openbbm/issues) section. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
   - Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
   - Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible, if the enhancement affects an existing feature, describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead.
   - Explain why it would be useful, and why is it necessary.
   
## Pull requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
   - Use a clear and descriptive title and description for the PR.
   - Include the relevant issue number, if there is no issue created you must create one following the [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) section.
   - You can drag and drop screenshots to showcase what your work implements.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional information before your pull request can be accepted. 

Comments and answers to these questions inside the Pull Request should always show respect to all parties.
